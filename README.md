# Ad-Click-Prediction
project aims to build a machine learning model to predict ad clicks based on user behavior data. algorithms like Logistic Regression, k-NN, and Random Forest are explored. The best model is selected via hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
